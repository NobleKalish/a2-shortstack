## Database character selection
- the domain area the project pertains to is creating data that is persistent until the server restarts and takes inputs by the user 
- the main challenges or problems the application addresses is keeping a documentation of characters created by the user. 
- the key innovations that make it possible to address the problem is using pouchdb to store character info and be accessible to the user
- the main results of the implementation, does it really address the problem? It does address the problem as the user can always keep their characters in order
- any additional implications of the resulting application, or possibly areas for future work that have been discovered as part of the design and implementation activities

(Note that when I use the above formula, I aim to have only one sentence per thought in order to remain concise.)

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I used pouchdb to create a data base so i did not have to rely on the server js.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: I also had to use browserify to be able to create pouchdb inside of my scripts.js. This allowed me to have require in a separate js file.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Shown in the classes for the divs I used the bulma css framework to style my css. I didn't follow any specific guide but used their documentation to create what i wanted
